## Description
This application is called the Note Taker and it can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The applicationâ€™s front end was already been created. So a back end has been created to, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
